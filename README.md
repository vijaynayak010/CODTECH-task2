Overview of the Project

Project :RECIPE FINDER APPLICATION

Users can enter ingredients into a text field and add them to a list.
Added ingredients can be deleted individually.
Clicking the "Search Recipes" button searches for recipes based on the listed ingredients using an external API (Edamam).
Search results are displayed in individual cards with recipe title, image, and ingredient list.
A "Home" button takes users back to the main page (presumably index.html).
Technologies Used:
HTML: Creates the basic structure of the web page, including elements for user input, ingredient list, recipe results, buttons, etc.
CSS: Styles the layout and appearance of the application, including colors, fonts, spacing, and button styles.
JavaScript: Handles user interactions, such as adding/deleting ingredients, triggering searches, and manipulating the DOM to display results.
Fetch API: Used by JavaScript to perform asynchronous HTTP requests to the Edamam recipe search API.
Edamam API: An external API (not directly included in the code) that provides recipe information based on ingredient queries.
